Software Architecture Reconstruction Assignment

The system chosen as a case study for reconstruction is called Zeeguu-API and is currently deployed as the backend for an existing website called zeeguu.org. The system is an open API that allows modeling and personalized tracking of the progress of a user, in multiple languages. 

The available features of the system are following:
- Create and manage user profiles.
- Access assets of each language like articles and videos.
- Track users progress and performance in language learning activities
- Receive personalized recommendations and feedback based on user performance and interests

The Zeeguu-API modular architecture allows developers to build on the existing code base and improve its functionalities. The modules included in the project are:
- authentication module, 
- the database module, 
- the recommendation module and others.
